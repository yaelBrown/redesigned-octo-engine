This accomplishment is a testament to the growing ecosystem and the dedication of talented teams working tirelessly to advance the future of Web 3.0.

The best way to do so is to fund open source software and open access research. But we also decided to make the whole application and review process open, and now process more than 90% of all grant applications and milestone reviews publicly on GitHub. This openness has led to more scrutiny, particularly around funding decisions, but also greater\xa0trust.</p><p>The Grants Program maintains strong relationships with other grant programs, both inside and outside the Polkadot ecosystem. The program has successfully encouraged innovation and growth in the decentralized ecosystem by providing initial funding for projects. Many of these projects go on to get more support from sources like VC investments or on-chain treasuries.</p><p>Successful parachains like Moonbeam and Astar, which received W3F grants funding early on, are great examples of this success. But this is only a small part of the long list of small projects that developed into successful parachains: roughly three-quarters of the parachain teams on Kusama and Polkadot signed one or more grants with us, and 60% of them successfully completed at least 1\xa0grant.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JqDRTxOTvoMDS3JFJsIpcg.png" /></figure><p>The program’s achievements can also be seen in the large quantity of repositories with high engagement, such as <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge">WasmEdge</a>, Hyperledger’s <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/solang">Solang</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer">Gossamer</a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library">Open Runtime Module Library</a>, to name a few. Due to the transparent nature of the current setup, the grants program could also be transferred on-chain at a later point and therefore is an ideal playing field for a decentralized system.</p><p>Since the program’s launch in December 2018, we have received an impressive 1238 applications, with 532 being accepted. To date, 230 dedicated teams have successfully completed their projects, and 410 have completed their first milestone. To explore the full list of accepted applications, please see\xa0<a href="https://w3f.github.io/Grants-Program/applications">here</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*3BE4piyEJcei0eWs" /></figure><h3>Current project\xa0areas</h3><p>To date, the signed grants encompass every aspect of the Web3 technology stack. Over half are dedicated to runtime modules and development tools.

Web3 Foundation grantees come from all around the world, with the largest economies, the US and China, continuing to dominate the space with 15.9% and 11.5% of applicants respectively. Notably, smaller countries such as Singapore and Switzerland are also making their mark, contributing 7.4% and 5.6% of applicants. This diversity and range of ideas is part of what makes the Web3 ecosystem so exciting, and we can’t wait to see what the future\xa0holds.</p><h3>Get in\xa0touch</h3><p>For more information about the grants program, join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!XpynPDLusWUWfDpaqr:matrix.org?via=web3.foundation&amp;via=matrix.org">Matrix community channel</a>, visit <a href="http://web3.foundation/grants">web3.foundation/grants</a> or head over directly to our <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pulls">GitHub repository</a> or its <a href="https://w3f.github.io/Grants-Program/">dedicated frontend</a>.

3.0 ecosystem, as more and more talented teams join us, whether they’re self-funded, supported by our grants program or other public funding sources, or driven purely by their passion for the development of this technology.</p><h3>Apply Now!</h3><p>As the momentum of Wave 17 unfolds, the ecosystem is experiencing not only the addition of more parachains but also the extension of existing leases. With the vast potential of Web 3.0 becoming ever more apparent, we foresee the sustained influx of grant applications to persist. If you are interested in receiving a W3F grant, please reach out! Applying for a grant is as simple as submitting a pull request to our <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program">grants program repository</a>. For inspiration, an overview of projects in the ecosystem, and broad project ideas we’re interested in funding, you can take a look at our open-source <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source">tech stack</a>. The best way to get your proposal accepted is to outline a comprehensive roadmap. Going over <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#guidelines">our guidelines</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/application-template.md">application template</a>, will give you a general idea of what we look for in a grant application.</p><p>For more information on how to apply and tips on putting together a great application, check out the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/faq.md">FAQs</a> in our grants program repository on GitHub.

3.0 ecosystem, as more and more talented teams join us, whether they’re self-funded, supported by our grants program or other public funding sources, or driven purely by their passion for the development of this technology.</p><h3>Apply Now!</h3><p>As the momentum of Wave 17 unfolds, the ecosystem is experiencing not only the addition of more parachains but also the extension of existing leases. With the vast potential of Web 3.0 becoming ever more apparent, we foresee the sustained influx of grant applications to persist. If you are interested in receiving a W3F grant, please reach out! Applying for a grant is as simple as submitting a pull request to our <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program">grants program repository</a>. For inspiration, an overview of projects in the ecosystem, and broad project ideas we’re interested in funding, you can take a look at our open-source <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source">tech stack</a>. The best way to get your proposal accepted is to outline a comprehensive roadmap. Going over <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#guidelines">our guidelines</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/application-template.md">application template</a>, will give you a general idea of what we look for in a grant application.</p><p>For more information on how to apply and tips on putting together a great application, check out the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/faq.md">FAQs</a> in our grants program repository on GitHub. We look forward to receiving your application! Together, let’s create a truly decentralised and connected future.</p><h3>Work with\xa0us!</h3><p>The grants program aims to be as open and accessible as possible. If you’re interested in contributing or getting involved, there are several ways you can do\xa0that:</p><ul><li>We are open to milestone evaluations from third parties. If you’re particularly interested in a certain project, or particularly knowledgeable on a relevant subject, <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery#ballot_box_with_check-external-evaluations">submit your own evaluation</a>.</li><li>We encourage anyone to submit a request for proposals (RFPs). If you find that there is something missing in our ecosystem (a tool, a project, infrastructure, etc.), that we could help fund, please <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md#mailbox_with_mail-suggest-a-project">submit an\xa0RFP</a>.</li><li>Join us! We’re looking for a Site Reliability Engineer and a Technical Educator to join us full-time.

In the first year, over 60 grants were awarded through the General Grants Program. The following year, the Open Grants Program was introduced, and the number of grants more than doubled, totaling 147. In 2021, an additional 123 grants were signed. And now, in 2022, we are pleased to announce that a total of 150 grants were signed\u200a—\u200amore than in any year before! In addition to that, 267 grant applications were received, and 230 grant milestones were delivered.</p><p>In 2022, the Web3 Foundation’s grant program reached two major milestones: receiving its 1000th grant application and supporting its 400th project. It comes as no surprise that Polkadot development saw an all-time high in 2022, with a peak of nearly 2500 monthly active developers. This made Polkadot one of the most active developer communities outside of Ethereum throughout the year. In order for the grants program to further continue to support and empower the growing developer community, we launched a <a href="https://w3f.github.io/Grants-Program/">web-based UI</a> that allows readers to get more familiar with the grants program and explore all signed grants, completed waves, RFPs, and other docs in a more user-friendly manner.</p><p>We’re delighted to see the number of talented teams contributing to the Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate tech stack grow and we’re continuously looking for new projects to support in order to continue the expansion of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. If you’re interested, we invite you to apply or reach out to us as explained below.</p><h3>Recipients 🚀</h3><p>We maintain a list of all accepted applications on our grants repository <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/index.md">here</a>.

In the first year, over 60 grants were awarded through the General Grants Program. The following year, the Open Grants Program was introduced, and the number of grants more than doubled, totaling 147. In 2021, an additional 123 grants were signed. And now, in 2022, we are pleased to announce that a total of 150 grants were signed\u200a—\u200amore than in any year before! In addition to that, 267 grant applications were received, and 230 grant milestones were delivered.</p><p>In 2022, the Web3 Foundation’s grant program reached two major milestones: receiving its 1000th grant application and supporting its 400th project. It comes as no surprise that Polkadot development saw an all-time high in 2022, with a peak of nearly 2500 monthly active developers. This made Polkadot one of the most active developer communities outside of Ethereum throughout the year. In order for the grants program to further continue to support and empower the growing developer community, we launched a <a href="https://w3f.github.io/Grants-Program/">web-based UI</a> that allows readers to get more familiar with the grants program and explore all signed grants, completed waves, RFPs, and other docs in a more user-friendly manner.</p><p>We’re delighted to see the number of talented teams contributing to the Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate tech stack grow and we’re continuously looking for new projects to support in order to continue the expansion of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. If you’re interested, we invite you to apply or reach out to us as explained below.</p><h3>Recipients 🚀</h3><p>We maintain a list of all accepted applications on our grants repository <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/index.md">here</a>.

It Is Software.</strong></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fbIDVNEdqWW-0RuWKksBSA.png" /></figure><p><em>Daniel Schoenberger, Chief Legal Officer, Web3 Foundation</em></p><p>Three years ago, in November 2019, Web3 Foundation made a decision that changed its trajectory and led to a transformation in business processes, people management and communications to the general public. We chose to take the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) up on its offer to “come in and talk to us.” Today, we will tell you why. Web3 Foundation is pleased to announce a landmark achievement towards the realization of Web 3.0: the Polkadot blockchain’s native digital asset (DOT) has morphed and is no longer a security. It is software.</p><h4><strong>Web 3.0</strong></h4><p>In 2014, Dr. Gavin Wood, the founder of Web3 Foundation, coined the term “Web 3.0” to describe a decentralized, trustless, serverless internet where users control their own data, identity and destiny. He presented this new vision because he believed that the current internet infrastructure (i.e., Web 2.0) encouraged and facilitated the consolidation of power by a dominant group of for-profit entities, many of which were instrumental in building such infrastructure. In Dr. Wood’s view, the Web 2.0 internet failed to meet basic human expectations of privacy and authenticity, and not by accident, but by design. Many, if not most, of those well known entities that are central to the average person’s Web 2.0 experience rely upon advertising as their sole method of making money. In addition, and closely related to advertising, robust online tracking and data mining may obfuscate the truth. Far from being a public utility, Web 2.0 is a business. The customer, seeking an online experience, may, unwittingly, become the product, potentially even without his or her knowledge of being monitored and influenced.</p><p>The Web3 Foundation’s official mission contemplated a web that would remove the human conflict of interest that exists between creators and consumers of online content and applications. The goal of Web 3.0 was to create a new internet infrastructure that could provide citizens with a meaningful alternative to Web 2.0\u200a—\u200aan internet that would continue to provide the features and benefits that they expected from the Web 2.0 world, but in a more secure, decentralized, privacy-protecting format. Ideally, Web 3.0 would enable individuals, not simply a cluster of powerful, for-profit, advertising-driven entities, to control their own personal data, including home addresses, cell phone numbers, healthcare histories and many other forms of personal identifiable information.</p><p>One way to create such a decentralized internet was by using blockchain technology, with Polkadot as the optimal design implementation. The vision of Polkadot was to contribute a base layer of vertical, use case-agnostic, coordinating software that would ultimately help create a viable alternative to Web 2.0 for citizens. Much like HTTP provided rails for communication in Web 2.0, once built, Polkadot could enable blockchain interoperability and cross-blockchain communications in Web 3.0. Yet, rather than invoking the well known “blockchain trilemma,” the Polkadot developer team set the bar higher, making clear that decentralization and security are not optional in the search for scalability.</p><p>The aim was always high, because the goal <em>mattered</em>. Interoperability and cross-chain messaging are not marketing gimmicks. They are critical to achieving Web\xa03.0.</p><p>Over the past several years, the blockchain space has developed into a diverse ecosystem, with many independently valuable communities, with varying cultures and goals. However, the individual elements of the blockchain industry continue to lack the benefits of a more mature, coordinated system. In other words, the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. Rather than functioning as an accessible online world, there remains a zero-sum aspect to it, as blockchains largely have remained\xa0siloed.</p><h4><strong>Come In and Talk to\xa0Us</strong></h4><p>In November 2019, three years after the release of the <a href="https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf">Polkadot white paper</a>, Web3 Foundation was still six months away from beginning the Polkadot network launch process, which would start in May 2020 and conclude with the final launch of parachains in December 2021. Yet we were at a crossroads.</p><p>Only months before, in April 2019, the staff of the SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (“FinHub”) had published its Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets (the “Framework”). The Framework’s factors suggested that nearly every digital asset offered and sold for fundraising purposes, initially, was highly likely to constitute a security in the hands of initial purchasers. Yet the Framework also contained factors that indicated the existence of a compliant path forward\u200a—\u200aone that would permit a digital asset initially offered and sold as a security to be re-evaluated at a later date. A path that, under certain circumstances, would allow a digital asset, for purposes of U.S. federal securities laws, to no longer be a security. In other words, to\xa0<em>morph</em>.</p><p>Beginning in 2017, prior to the release of the SEC’s landmark 21A Report of Investigation: The DAO (“The DAO Report”), the Web3 Foundation had fundraised, in compliance with U.S. federal securities laws, but, as of November 2019, we had not yet delivered any digital assets to initial purchasers. While the Polkadot vision had not contemplated that the blockchain’s native token would be a security, we understood that the SEC’s view was likely to be that the to-be-delivered token would be a security, at least at the time of delivery.</p><p>As we saw it, the stakes were high, and the margin for error was slim. Whatever it took in order for DOT, the native token of the Polkadot blockchain to be\u200a—\u200aor to become\u200a—\u200aa non-security, we were willing to do it.

It Is Software.</strong></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fbIDVNEdqWW-0RuWKksBSA.png" /></figure><p><em>Daniel Schoenberger, Chief Legal Officer, Web3 Foundation</em></p><p>Three years ago, in November 2019, Web3 Foundation made a decision that changed its trajectory and led to a transformation in business processes, people management and communications to the general public. We chose to take the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) up on its offer to “come in and talk to us.” Today, we will tell you why. Web3 Foundation is pleased to announce a landmark achievement towards the realization of Web 3.0: the Polkadot blockchain’s native digital asset (DOT) has morphed and is no longer a security. It is software.</p><h4><strong>Web 3.0</strong></h4><p>In 2014, Dr. Gavin Wood, the founder of Web3 Foundation, coined the term “Web 3.0” to describe a decentralized, trustless, serverless internet where users control their own data, identity and destiny. He presented this new vision because he believed that the current internet infrastructure (i.e., Web 2.0) encouraged and facilitated the consolidation of power by a dominant group of for-profit entities, many of which were instrumental in building such infrastructure. In Dr. Wood’s view, the Web 2.0 internet failed to meet basic human expectations of privacy and authenticity, and not by accident, but by design. Many, if not most, of those well known entities that are central to the average person’s Web 2.0 experience rely upon advertising as their sole method of making money. In addition, and closely related to advertising, robust online tracking and data mining may obfuscate the truth. Far from being a public utility, Web 2.0 is a business. The customer, seeking an online experience, may, unwittingly, become the product, potentially even without his or her knowledge of being monitored and influenced.</p><p>The Web3 Foundation’s official mission contemplated a web that would remove the human conflict of interest that exists between creators and consumers of online content and applications. The goal of Web 3.0 was to create a new internet infrastructure that could provide citizens with a meaningful alternative to Web 2.0\u200a—\u200aan internet that would continue to provide the features and benefits that they expected from the Web 2.0 world, but in a more secure, decentralized, privacy-protecting format. Ideally, Web 3.0 would enable individuals, not simply a cluster of powerful, for-profit, advertising-driven entities, to control their own personal data, including home addresses, cell phone numbers, healthcare histories and many other forms of personal identifiable information.</p><p>One way to create such a decentralized internet was by using blockchain technology, with Polkadot as the optimal design implementation. The vision of Polkadot was to contribute a base layer of vertical, use case-agnostic, coordinating software that would ultimately help create a viable alternative to Web 2.0 for citizens. Much like HTTP provided rails for communication in Web 2.0, once built, Polkadot could enable blockchain interoperability and cross-blockchain communications in Web 3.0. Yet, rather than invoking the well known “blockchain trilemma,” the Polkadot developer team set the bar higher, making clear that decentralization and security are not optional in the search for scalability.</p><p>The aim was always high, because the goal <em>mattered</em>. Interoperability and cross-chain messaging are not marketing gimmicks. They are critical to achieving Web\xa03.0.</p><p>Over the past several years, the blockchain space has developed into a diverse ecosystem, with many independently valuable communities, with varying cultures and goals. However, the individual elements of the blockchain industry continue to lack the benefits of a more mature, coordinated system. In other words, the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. Rather than functioning as an accessible online world, there remains a zero-sum aspect to it, as blockchains largely have remained\xa0siloed.</p><h4><strong>Come In and Talk to\xa0Us</strong></h4><p>In November 2019, three years after the release of the <a href="https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf">Polkadot white paper</a>, Web3 Foundation was still six months away from beginning the Polkadot network launch process, which would start in May 2020 and conclude with the final launch of parachains in December 2021. Yet we were at a crossroads.</p><p>Only months before, in April 2019, the staff of the SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (“FinHub”) had published its Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets (the “Framework”). The Framework’s factors suggested that nearly every digital asset offered and sold for fundraising purposes, initially, was highly likely to constitute a security in the hands of initial purchasers. Yet the Framework also contained factors that indicated the existence of a compliant path forward\u200a—\u200aone that would permit a digital asset initially offered and sold as a security to be re-evaluated at a later date. A path that, under certain circumstances, would allow a digital asset, for purposes of U.S. federal securities laws, to no longer be a security. In other words, to\xa0<em>morph</em>.</p><p>Beginning in 2017, prior to the release of the SEC’s landmark 21A Report of Investigation: The DAO (“The DAO Report”), the Web3 Foundation had fundraised, in compliance with U.S. federal securities laws, but, as of November 2019, we had not yet delivered any digital assets to initial purchasers. While the Polkadot vision had not contemplated that the blockchain’s native token would be a security, we understood that the SEC’s view was likely to be that the to-be-delivered token would be a security, at least at the time of delivery.</p><p>As we saw it, the stakes were high, and the margin for error was slim. Whatever it took in order for DOT, the native token of the Polkadot blockchain to be\u200a—\u200aor to become\u200a—\u200aa non-security, we were willing to do it. And so, we decided to try to take the SEC’s FinHub staff up on the offer to “come in and talk to\xa0us.”</p><p>November 2022 marks the three year anniversary of our engagement with the SEC. For three years, we have met regularly with the FinHub staff. In doing so, we have adopted an approach to compliance that is similar to our approach to technical development: head down and dedicated, while setting the bar high.

In this wave we’ve signed 36 grants, and we’d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the amazing teams that are working hard to create a better, more secure, and more decentralized web.</p><p>Wave 14 brings a variety of inspiring projects from a wide range of fields. Some of the highlights include grants related to innovative wallet solutions, tooling around <em>ink!</em> smart contracts, interesting developments in cryptography, as well as a high number of ui-related grants. We’re also thrilled with the ever growing number of teams applying with the aim to implement the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfps">RFPs</a> that were published by Web3 Foundation and the community, and we’re looking forward to the continuation of this trend. We also would like to take the chance to welcome our intern, Lucas, to our\xa0team.</p><p>It’s exciting to see the number of talented teams contributing to the Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate tech stack, whether they’re self-funded, supported by the grants program or <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#rocket-alternative-funding-sources">other public funding sources</a>, or simply motivated by their passion for the further development of Web 3.0 technologies. We’re continuously looking for new projects to support in order to continue the expansion of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. If you’re interested, we invite you to apply or reach out to us as explained below.</p><h3>Recipients 🚀</h3><p>We maintain a list of all accepted applications on our grants repository <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/index.md">here</a>.

Since the beginning of 2022, we’ve signed 31 grants supporting a variety of projects that aim to create a better, more decentralized web.</p><p>This wave has come with a lot of delightful changes to our ecosystem as well as to the grants team itself. The applications submitted and delivered by our grantees added plenty of value in several fields. Some of the highlights include an attestable oracle solution, different innovations in the ever-growing field of stablecoins, no-code platforms for the Substrate ecosystem, and much more. Various teams also applied for grants aiming to implement the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfps">RFPs</a> that were published by Web3 Foundation and the community. To top it off, we’re happy to welcome Ashley, Hakan, and Seraya to the grants\xa0team.</p><p>It’s exciting to see the number of talented teams contributing to the Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate tech stack, whether it’s voluntary, self-funded, or supported by the grants program or <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#rocket-alternative-funding-sources">other public funding sources</a>. We’re continuously looking for new projects to support in order to continue the expansion of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. If you’re interested, we invite you to apply or reach out to us as explained further down\xa0below.</p><h3>Recipients 🚀</h3><p>We maintain a list of all accepted applications on our grants repository <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/index.md">here</a>.
